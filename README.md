# Sonoff hack

## The project

The original idea and tutorial for this project can be found [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9pcBowAaXw) by [Eric Peronnin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3v5cVACw-5BKQOcwUaM8w) on how to hack the Sonoff relay modules.

The tutorial explains how to upload a new program to the Sonoff. The program creates a simple webserver you can then access on your phone's browser to control the relay switch.

You'll find the [original program here](http://geii.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=244&Itemid=955).

## Improvements

I liked the project and decided to make some improvements to the program. Here's what I have made so far:
- Cleaner and simpler HTML
- Only one button on the page

Improvements to come:
- Timer function with NTP support
- Better looking webpage
