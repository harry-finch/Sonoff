# Sonoff hack

I found the original program in this great [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9pcBowAaXw) by [Eric Peronnin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe3v5cVACw-5BKQOcwUaM8w) on how to hack the Sonoff relay modules.

The program creates a simple webserver that controls a relay switch.

Here are the improvements I have made so far:
- Cleaner and simpler HTML
- Only one button on the page

Improvements to come:
- Timer function with NTP support
- Better looking webpage
